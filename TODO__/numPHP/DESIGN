The project will be composed of packages and classes. All
of which will be named:
	pkg.<topic>.php (e.g. pkg.stats.php)
	class.<object>.php (e.g. class.complex.php)

The packages will contain related functions on a particular
topic in mathematical or numerical analysis.

The classes will be created for objects that are desgined
to be self-contained, or that implement a particular number
type not existent in the PHP core language, example: the
complex number class (class.complex.php)

Dependencies between packages and objects should be clearly
documented.

That's should enough for the general design features, at least
for now.
