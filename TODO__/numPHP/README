This is the initial release of numPHP, a set of function libraries
(packages) and classes to be used in numerical data manipulation.

The files included in this distribution are:

class.complex.php
	Class for manipulating complex numbers
class.hist.php
	Class to generate a histogram from an array of data
pkg.arith.php
	A set of simple arithmetic functions
pkg.geom.php
	Geometrical functions
pkg.stats.php
	Statistical functions for unidimensional data arrays
pkg.trig.php
	Trigonometric functions to complement the ones in PHP
utils.inc.php
	Utility functions (error handling, etc.) to be used by
	other packages or classes in numPHP

Test scripts are located in the "tests" subdir. All scripts have been
tested w/ PHP3 3.0.12 and 3.0.14, and PHP4 beta 3 and beta 4 pl 1.

There is plenty to do here, but the functions and clasess are quite
usable as they are now.
